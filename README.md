# Full-Stack Todo Web Application using SvelteKit and MongoDB
This is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage their to-do lists efficiently. The application is built using the SvelteKit framework on the front end and MongoDB on the back end to store and manage task data. The purpose of this project was to learn more about SvelteKit and to gain experience in building a full stack web application.

# Features
